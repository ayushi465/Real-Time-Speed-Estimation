**Project Name: SpeedSense: Real-Time Vehicle Speed Monitoring**

SpeedSense is a project designed to monitor vehicle speeds in real time using computer vision techniques. It employs OpenCV for video processing and integrates YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle detection, ensuring accurate and efficient speed estimation.

**Features**

Real-Time Speed Estimation: Utilizes OpenCV and YOLO for precise vehicle speed calculation from video streams.

Vehicle Detection: Implements YOLO object detection to identify and track vehicles within video frames.
Speed Monitoring: Flags vehicles exceeding predefined speed limits and logs speed data for further analysis.
Scalable Design: Engineered for integration into large-scale traffic management systems.
